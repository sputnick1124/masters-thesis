 abstract = "This paper describes an experiment on the “linguistic” synthesis of a controller for a model industrial plant (a steam engine), Fuzzy logic is used to convert heuristic control rues stated by a human operator into an automatic control strategy. The experiment was initiated to investigate the possibility of human interaction with a learning controller. However, the control strategy set up linguistically proved to be far better than expected in its own right, and the basic experiment of linguistic control synthesis in a non-learning controller is reported here."
