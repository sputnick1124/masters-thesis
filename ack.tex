I owe a great debt to my advisor, Dr. Kelly Cohen. Ever the motivator and champion, he has done more to build
the scaffold for my success than he knows. I also thank Dr. Manish Kumar for his example, intellect, guidance,
and support. I would be remiss without acknowledging and sincerely thanking my friends and colleagues: Bryan
Brown, for being my sounding board and making sure I always had the tools I needed (both literally and
figuratively) to accomplish my work; Nathaniel Richards for listening to my endless ramblings as I work out
ideas; Justin Ouwerkerk for lighting the fire of competition under me; and Anthony Lamping for letting me know
just how bad my code is, and for helping me make it better. All have helped me both directly and indirectly in
the completion of this thesis. Finally, I owe an unpayable debt to my wife, Lori. She has sustained me in
every way imaginable through this process.
