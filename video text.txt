The following screen shots come from videos of a simulation using the kalman filter and fuzzy controller,
landing the vehicle on both a stationary platform (cite figure) and a moving platform (cite figure).  The
video of the static platform shows the video output on the left of the screen, and tracks progress on the
state machine on the right of the screen.  As a state is completed, its color turns to gray. In the
screenshots, you can clearly see the vehicle taking off, traveling to the communicated waypoint, locating and
locking the location of the platform via image reconition, and initiating the approach & land states.  In the
moving platform video, the video output still appears on the left of the screen. The top right window shows 4
vehicles flying in the air. This represents the 3 estimates (visual, aprilTag, EKF) and simulation truth. It
shows that at the beginning of the vehicle, before a visual track is obtained, have large errors. As the
visual track is obtained, errors decrease.  The image below and to the left of that is the raw camera feed.
The image in the bottom right corner in the AprilTag detection output image.

Full video footage of both videos is avaiable for viewing...
