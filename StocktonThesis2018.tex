% It is better to break up the dissertation into multiple files (e.g.,
% one file per chapter, as well as separate files for the abstract,
% acknowledgements, and vita).  These files are brought into the
% document using \include{} statements.  There will be times, however,
% when you don't want to print the ENTIRE dissertation.  You can limit
% what will actually be printed by using the \includeonly{} statment.
% This contains a list of the files you want printed.  Any file NOT
% listed will not be printed.  However, all page numbers, references,
% etc., will be preserved as though all the files were actually
% printed. For example, the line below would result only in chapters 1
% and 3 being printed (if it were uncommented).
%

%\includeonly{ch1.intro,ch3.implem}

% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
%  In the newest format, titles should be title case everywhere.
%
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
%  In the new format, the titles of each chapter should appear in
%  uppercase.  In the TOC, however, they should be in lowercase.
%  The command below automates this behavior.  However, you'll have to be
%  careful not to include \labels within your \chapter definitions or
%  there will be problems.  If you don't want this to be automated, comment
%  out the \typesetChapterTitle definition below and do your chapters in
%  the form:
%  \chapter[MY TITLE]{My Title}
%
%  \renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{\uppercase{#1}}
\renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{#1}

\newcommand{\TODO}[1]{<TODO: #1>}

% If you get rid of \disscopyright, restore the \blankpage line after it

% Abstract goes here.

\begin{abstract}

%
% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
%  The graduate school does not require an external abstract. If this
%  changes, follow the old instructions below.
%
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
%  Uncomment the three lines below to generate the external abstract.  Two
%  copies of this must be turned in to the graduate school.  These lines can
%  be placed pretty much anywhere, since the page numbering should be
%  independent of the rest of the thesis
%

% \begin{externalabstract}
%   \input{abstract}
% \end{externalabstract}

%  My Dedication

%\dedication{To my wife, Lori, for her unending support and urging to get this thing over with.}


%
% Bring in Acknowledgement and Vita from separate files named ``ack.tex''
% and ``vita.tex''.

%\include{ack}

% Make the Table of Contents and other good stuff

% The following is a list of chapters.  Each is brought in from a
% separate file using the \include{} command.

% If you have appendices in your dissertation, you will need the
% following, else keep it commented. The following appendices are in
% files called ``app1.tex'', and ``app2.tex'', and they
% look just like any chapter.

% The all important bibliography file at the end of your document!! Use

% the name of the database.  See the LaTeX manual appendix B for details
% about the bibliography database and BibTeX.
